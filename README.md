# bookmarker
A bookmarking application coded in vanilla JavaScript using the Bootstrap framework.

Generates a form to enter website name and URL. A validation alert is fired if you do not enter a value in either field or if you do not enter a valid URL. Upon submit, cards are generated for each bookmarked site. These cards contain a "Visit" button and a "Delete" button for each bookmarked site.
